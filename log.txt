Review 1 : 
So Beautiful, So elegant, just looking like a wow.

Review 2 : 
I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!

Screen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before. Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!

Hanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.

Battery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday – a definite win!

Comfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.

Image Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light. Selfies have never looked this good!

Color: I went for the classic Midnight color, and it's elegant and timeless. The finish adds a touch of sophistication, and it doesn't attract fingerprints like some other phones I've had in the past.

In summary, getting the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival was an absolute steal. From the incredible screen to the reliable battery life and stunning camera, it's exceeded my expectations. If you're on the fence, take the plunge – you won't be disappointed.

Review 1 : 
Stunning Design and a Beautiful Pink!

Review 2 : 
I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.

The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”

The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.

If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!

Review 1 : 
Still one of best base flagships out there in 2024

Review 2 : 
Things I liked:
1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)
2. Camera:
-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.
3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.
4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.
5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.

Things I wish were better:
1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)

2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%

3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.

4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts. Number pad does not detect contact unless complete number is typed.

Review 1 : 
Android to Apple Transition - Not a very smooth experience

Review 2 : 
This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-
1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User
2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.
3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.
4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.
5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.
6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet "A", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.
7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.
8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.
9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.

These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customization is really good and you can customize a lot of things.

Review 1 : 
Iphone 13

Review 2 : 
After purchasing the iPhone 13, I’m genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here’s a detailed review based on my experience:

### Design and Build Quality
The iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.

### Display
The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.

### Performance
The A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It’s clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.

### Camera
The camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.

### Battery Life
Battery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.

### Software
iOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.

### Overall Impression
The iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it’s the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience.

No charger

Review 2 : 
Every thing is good about iPhones, there's nothing compared to it's speed and ios but i was disappointed because there's no charger for it even though Indian judiciary told them to provide , still they haven't made any progress regarding charger. Why should we spend 62k and more than that for iPhones because of it's brand and Acessories comfort size and Features right if that's not there what's point of buying an iPhone.
Thank you

Review 1 : 
feel good yet(6 month)

Review 2 : 
IOS 17.5 (current version updated from 16.6)
Thw worst thing as a ios user for me that the fear of update , i heared some updates get display issues battery drain issues , god sake i doesn't had any issues from ios updates , but till i care
- device was great, super handy for me, little feeling of weight .
Display
- The 60Hz refresh rate didn't felt badly form me cause i am used such kind of device before.
- The brightness Range is so comfortable.
- The 2160p60 HDR videos in youtube give blissful experiance
Battery And charging
- The charging time:- i took 1Hour to charge from 20% to 91% using apple 20w original adapter and cable without any interruption(no electricity break or disconnection ,calls etc)
- Battery backup - I am mostly maintain battery in btw 20% <-> 80% so i think this may get one day backup for me ,Average 5h screen on time
The one day backup is just a advertisemnt advertisement label usaully we use, actually a day like events,party,outing we use -camera ,editing app, social media app more than usual use , that day i didn't get a satisfied backup .
- Little temperature warming while charging , no heating issue
- battery health after 6 month 98%
-battery cycle count 194 after 6 month
Perfomance
- Good perfomance for video editing ,photography , social media . (I am not a gamer )
Camera
- Even though i felt some lag or stuck screens in some third party applications
- The cinematic Mode is mind Blowing . i missed 13 pro or higher varients for zooming in this mode .
- Actually i really miss pro variant for the tele lens and camera features while i using this . Cost is wall for me.
- The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .
- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.
AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATE
i turned off the auto update at first place .
i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.
So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened . Buy the way it is a hardware issue one of the display provider company's batch may show the issues . but we customers cannot identify which company provides the hardaware.
I will attach my battery analytics data screnshot photo here so you can better understand how the battery is good
The ordering experience in the greate indian sale was worst . I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .
As a whole i didn't recommend base models ,i felt i must have buy pro variant but for person who need ios in affordable price i recommend 13 is better than 14

Review 2 : 
The iPhone 13 is a solid upgrade, especially for those coming from older models. Its improvements in battery life, camera capabilities, and processing power make it a worthwhile consideration. However, if you already have an iPhone 12, the changes might not be significant enough to justify an immediate upgrade unless the new camera features or increased battery life are particularly important to you

Review 1 : 
Mobile phone getting overheated

Review 2 : 
Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:
Product red 128GB
Pros:
1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)
2) Built quality excellent
3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.
4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.
5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.
6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.
7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thump

Cons:
1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.
2) File management system sucks, android is much better.
3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.
4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.
5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.
6) No USB C
7) Siri is dumb AF
8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.
9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.
10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.
11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16

Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.

Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.

Hope this helps in making your decision easier.

Update after 2 weeks of usage:

All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.
1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.
2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.

I tried to flip camera while recording but no facility is added here. You have to pause first then you can flip from back to front or vice versa it means you can't continue it, very awkward position. Iphone software should be upgraded so that we can make it go. It's very essential for a content creator. I purchased gimbal dji om se but it could not provided that, it's very essential for a vlogger but I was fed up after finding the basic requirements wasn't built in these products !

Review 2 : 
We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.

Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.

The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.

The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo’s beard as he stared up into the sun.

DISPLAY
1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive
2. Slightly different button placement
3. Pink and blue are standout colors
4. New Green color launched March 2022

CAMERA
1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung
2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode
3. Photographic styles give you creative control

VIDEO
1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh
2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video quality

PERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic
1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again
2. Machine learning performance notably better

BATTERY LIFE
1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12

Software
1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends
2. Focus cuts down on distractions

VERDICT :
The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12’s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn’t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.

I don’t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic’s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.

I’m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I’d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around — be it via USB-C or MagSafe — as well as a 120Hz display.

The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.

Writing this review after using the phone for 5 months.
Pros
- camera clicks amazing pictures, video recording is the best I've seen in a phone so far compared to my previous phones. Stable videos with no shaking
- battery life is good. Lasts an entire day with medium use. I don't game on the phone. Charging is as quick as it is with phones that use USB C.
- display is soo good. So bright
- built is solid, dropped phone a couple of times once with the cover and once without and not even a scratch.
- listening to music and watching videos is a hot cos of how good the speakers r. Crystal clear with the right amount of bass and treble.

Cons
- phone is a tad heavy and using it for hrs on a stretch can result in pain in the wrist or fingers

Got the phone in Diwali sale on discount so bang for buck if u ask me
